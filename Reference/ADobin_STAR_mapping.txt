Alternate Protocol 7: Mapping RNA-seq reads, generating output in transcriptomic coordinates and using RSEM to quantify expression of transcripts and genes

Quantifying expression of RNA transcripts and genes is one of the most important tasks in the analysis of RNA-seq data. RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011) is a popular software package capable of quantifying annotated genes and transcripts using RNA-seq data. In this Protocol STAR outputs genomic alignments in transcriptomic coordinates, which are then used by RSEM to produce transcript/gene quantifications.
Necessary Resources

Hardware

Same as in the Basic Protocol.

Software

Same as in the Basic Protocol, and RSEM 1.2.20. For downloading and installing instructions refer to RSEM web-sites: http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/ or https://github.com/bli25wisc/RSEM. It is assumed that RSEM is installed in ~/star/code/RSEM-1.2.20

Input files

Same as in the Basic Protocol.

Running a mapping job with transcriptomic output

1. Make a “run directory” for and switch to it:

mkdir ~/star/alt_rsem
cd ~/star/alt_rsem

2. Map the gzipped FASTQ files located in the ~/star/ directory (see Input Files) outputting unsorted and coordinate-sorted BAMs:

~/star/code/STAR-STAR_2.4.0k/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR \
--runThreadN 12 --genomeDir ~/star/genome/ \
--sjdbGTFfile ~/star/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.79.gtf --sjdbOverhang 100 \
--readFilesIn ~/star/ENCFF001RFH.fastq.gz ~/star/ENCFF001RFG.fastq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat \
--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM

The ---quantMode TranscriptomeSAM option activates the transcriptomic output.

3. All the output files are the same as in Basic Protocol 4-5 with addition to the BAM file in transcriptomic coordinates:

18G Aligned.toTranscriptome.out.bam

Note references in this file are annotated transcript sequences, in contrast to genomic SAM/BAM files in which references are genomic sequences (chromosomes).

4. Prepare the RSEM reference files. This step needs to be done only once for given genome assembly (FASTA) and annotations (GTF).

Make a directory to store RSEM reference files:

mkdir ~/star/rsem_ref

Switch to the RSEM source directory:

cd ~/star/code/RSEM-1.2.20

Run RSEM to prepare the reference file:

./rsem-prepare-reference --gtf ~/star/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.79.gtf \
~/star/genome/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa ./ref

5. Run RSEM quantification on the STAR transcriptomic BAM file:

rsem-calculate-expression --bam --no-bam-output -p 12 --paired-end --forward-prob 0 \
~/star/alt_rsem/Aligned.toTranscriptome.out.bam ~/star/rsem_ref/ref ~/star/alt_rsem/Quant \
>& ~/star/alt_rsem/rsem.log

--paired-end --forward-prob 0 options are applicable to paired stranded RNA-seq data such as Illumina stranded Tru-seq protocol. Refer to RSEM documentation for detailed description of RSEM parameters.

-p 12 defines the number of threads used by RSEM.

6. RSEM produces the following files with isoform (transcript) and gene expression levels (refer to RSEM documentation for detailed description of the RSEM output format):

13M Quant.isoforms.results
5.7M Quant.genes.results

Alternate Protocol 8: Mapping RNA-seq reads and running Cufflinks to assemble and quantify transcripts for stranded RNA-seq data

Cufflinks (Trapnell et al 2010) is a popular software package for assembly and quantification of transcript using RNA-seq data. In this protocol STAR outputs BAM file with coordinate-sorted alignments, which is then used by Cufflinks to assemble and quantify novel transcript structures. This Protocol works with stranded RNA-seq data, such as Illumina stranded Tru-Seq protocol. For un-stranded RNA-seq data see the Alternate Protocol 8.

Hardware

Same as in the Basic Protocol.

Software

Same as in the Basic Protocol, plus Cufflinks 2.2.1. To download and install Cufflinks into ~/star/code/directory:

cd ~/star/code
wget http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/assets/downloads/cufflinks-2.2.1.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar xvfz cufflinks-2.2.1.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

Input files

Same as in the Basic Protocol.

Generating the coordinate-sorted BAM file and running Cufflinks transcript assembly and quantification

1. Follow Alternate Protocol 3 to produce the Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam file. If you do not require unsorted BAM file, use --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate option to generate only the coordinate-sorted file.

2. In the STAR run directory ~/star/alt_bam/, run the basic Cufflinks command:

cd ~/star/alt_bam
~/star/code/cufflinks-2.2.1.Linux_x86_64/cufflinks -p 12 --library-type fr-firststrand \
Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam

-p 12 defines the number of threads used by Cufflinks.

--library-type fr-firststrand parameter has to be chosen according to the RNA-seq library protocol. Use fr-firststrand option for the protocols in which the 1st read is on the opposite strand to the RNA molecule (such as Illumina stranded Tru-Seq). Use fr-secondstrand for the protocols in which the 1st read is on the same strand as the RNA molecule. For un-stranded RNA-seq data use Alternative Protocol 8. For other library types, refer to Cufflinks documentation.

3. Cufflinks generates the following output:

89M transcripts.gtf
8.1M genes.fpkm_tracking
11M isoforms.fpkm_tracking

The first file contains transcripts assembled from the RNA-seq data, while the 2nd and 3rd files contain tables of gene and transcript-level expression. For a description of output formats, as well as advanced Cufflinks options, please refer to the Cufflinks documentation: http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cufflinks/index.html

Cufflinks (Trapnell et al 2010) is a popular software package for assembly and quantification of transcript using RNA-seq data. In this protocol STAR outputs BAM file with coordinate-sorted alignments, which is then used by Cufflinks to assemble and quantify novel transcript structures.

Generating the coordinate-sorted BAM file and running Cufflinks transcript assembly and quantification

1. Make a run directory and switch to it:

mkdir ~/star/alt_cuff-unstr
cd ~/star/alt_cuff-unstr

2. Map the FASTQ files located in the ~/star/directory (see Input Files) outputting coordinate-sorted BAM:

~/star/code/STAR-STAR_2.4.0k/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR\
--runThreadN 12 --genomeDir ~/star/genome/ \
--sjdbGTFfile ~/star/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.79.gtf --sjdbOverhang 100 \
--readFilesIn ~/star/ENCFF001RFH.fastq.gz ~/star/ENCFF001RFG.fastq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat \
--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate Unsorted \
--outSAMstrandField intronMotif

--outSAMstrandField intronMotif option adds an XS attribute to the spliced alignments in the BAM file, which is required by Cufflinks for unstranded RNA-seq data.

2. In the same directory run the basic Cufflinks command:

~/star/code/cufflinks-2.2.1.Linux_x86_64/cufflinks -p 12 Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam

-p 12 defines the number of threads used by Cufflinks.

3. Cufflinks output files are described in Alternative Protocol 7.
